# primitive features
# We include "positive" and "negative" features as primitives (instead of definining the latter via negation) for two reasons.
# (1) Conceptually, it's not clear that the positive ones are any more basic than the negative ones.  But defining them in
# terms of negation would make them more complex according to our measure.
# (2) Computationally, this greatly shrinks the space of grammatical expressions that need to be explored before finding one
# that expresses each meaning.  Better search and/or minimization algorithms would help here.
