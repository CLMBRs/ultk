	bool -> and(bool, bool)
	bool -> not(bool)
	bool -> or(bool, bool)
	bool -> diff(frozenset, frozenset)
	bool -> =(int, int)
	bool -> =f(float, float)
	bool -> >(int, int)
	bool -> >f(float, float)
	bool -> intersection(frozenset, frozenset)
	bool -> %(int, int)
	int -> cardinality(frozenset)
	int -> -(int, int)
	int -> +(int, int)
	float -> /(int, int)
